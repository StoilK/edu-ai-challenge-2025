You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing user feedback about a product. Follow these rules and output your analysis in the specified JSON structure.

Instructions:
Relevance Check (Chain-of-Thought Reasoning):
First, determine whether the feedback is relevant to the product (e.g., discusses its features, usage experience, build quality, performance).

If not relevant, set "isRelevant" to false and do not perform any further analysis—leave all other fields empty or null as appropriate.

If relevant, set "isRelevant" to true and proceed with the full analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:
Determine the overall sentiment of the feedback: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", "Mixed" or empty String if not relevant.

Subject Identification:
Identify the main subject or focus of the user's feedback (e.g., performance, ergonomics, material quality).

Key Elements Extraction:

"positives": Specific praises or appreciated aspects.

"painPoints": Issues or complaints.

"improvementSuggestions": User's suggestions to improve the product.

"featuresMentioned": Any specific features the user refers to.

"userExpertise": Determine if the user is "Experienced", "Novice", or "Unknown" based on language and context.

Output Format:
Return your results in this strict JSON format:

{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}
Learn from these Examples:
Feedback 1:
"I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knuckles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO especially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."

{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Ergonomics and shape (compared favorably to GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO",
    "Better rear portion ergonomics",
    "Better side grip area"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Ergonomics",
    "Shape",
    "Rear design",
    "Side grip"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Feedback 2:
"If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought was wrong about the GPX series: they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."

{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Feature improvements over competitor (GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Better shape than GPX series",
    "Improved side buttons",
    "Better scrolling wheel",
    "Faster gliding with good control-speed balance"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shape",
    "Side buttons",
    "Scrolling wheel",
    "Gliding performance"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Feedback 3:
"I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, either—the plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."

{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Material quality and feel",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Shell material attracts fingerprints excessively",
    "Requires frequent cleaning",
    "Material feels cheap",
    "Design prioritizes weight over premium feel"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Use material that resists fingerprints better",
    "Improve perceived build quality while maintaining low weight"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shell material",
    "Build quality feel",
    "Weight"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Now analyze the following feedback using the same structure and logic.
Comment 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
Comment 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
Comment 3: "My man... I wish my Spanish was 1/10th as good as your English grammar. Nice review sir!"
