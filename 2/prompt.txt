When I provide a note or bug report (e.g., "Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond."), convert it into a structured bug ticket using the following format:

Title: A concise summary of the bug.
Description: A short paragraph explaining the bug in more detail.
Steps to Reproduce: A numbered list of specific steps that reliably reproduce the issue.
Expected vs Actual Behavior: A comparison between what should happen and what actually happens.
Environment (if known): Browser, OS, device, app version, etc.
Severity or Impact: A brief note on how critical the bug is (e.g., low, medium, high, blocks login, etc.).
