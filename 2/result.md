Title: Logout Button Unresponsive on Safari

Description:
The logout button fails to work when clicked on Safari. When a user attempts to log out, the button does not trigger any response, preventing the user from leaving their session. This behavior disrupts the intended flow and could lead to security concerns if users cannot properly log out.

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the application in the Safari browser.

Log in with valid user credentials.

Navigate to the user account or settings page where the logout button is located.

Click on the logout button.

Expected vs Actual Behavior:

Expected: After clicking the logout button, the user should be logged out and redirected to the login page or a confirmation screen.

Actual: The logout button does not respond, and the user remains logged in without any feedback.

Environment (if known):

Browser: Safari

Operating System: Assumed macOS (inferred from Safari usage)

Device: Desktop

App Version: Not specified (assumed current/latest version)

Severity or Impact:
Medium â€“ This bug impacts user experience and security by preventing proper session termination, but it does not block core functionality for users on other browsers.
