COVERAGE ANALYSIS
-----------------

Code Coverage Areas Tested:
✓ Enigma class constructor
✓ Rotor class constructor and methods  
✓ plugboardSwap function
✓ encryptChar method (core encryption logic)
✓ process method (text processing)
✓ stepRotors method (rotor advancement)
✓ Rotor forward/backward methods
✓ Special character handling
✓ Case conversion

Functional Areas Covered:
✓ Basic encryption/decryption symmetry
✓ Plugboard functionality (critical bug fix area)
✓ Rotor configuration and positioning
✓ Ring settings
✓ Rotor stepping behavior
✓ Complex multi-component configurations
✓ Edge cases (special chars, case sensitivity)
✓ Performance characteristics

BUG VERIFICATION
----------------
Critical Bug: Plugboard applied only once instead of twice
Status: FIXED and VERIFIED

Before Fix:
- Test 2 Plugboard Test: FAILED
- Input 'A' with A↔B plugboard → Encrypted to 'I' → Decrypted to 'B'
- Symmetry broken

After Fix:  
- Test 2 Plugboard Test: PASSED
- Input 'A' with A↔B plugboard → Encrypted to 'I' → Decrypted to 'A'  
- Symmetry restored

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. The Enigma machine implementation is now fully functional
2. All core features work correctly including the critical plugboard functionality
3. Performance is excellent for typical use cases
4. No additional fixes or modifications required
5. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage and should be run after any future changes
