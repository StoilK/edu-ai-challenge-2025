I need to select a proper Database for an application. 
Here are some requirements:
1. Social platform with millions of users
2. Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
3. High data read speed required
4. Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
5. Scalability is important as the user base grows

It's important to think step by step or use Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
I will need some justification before giving the final recommendation.
